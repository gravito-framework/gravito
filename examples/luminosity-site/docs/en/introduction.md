# Introduction

Luminosity is the intelligent **SmartMap Engine** for modern, data-intensive web applications. It automates your SEO strategy by managing sitemaps, robots.txt, and search engine pings with unparalleled precision.

## Why Luminosity?

Sitemaps are often an afterthought in web development. As your site grows to thousands or millions of pages, traditional sitemap generation becomes a bottleneck—slow, resource-heavy, and often stale.

Luminosity solves this with a revolutionary approach: **Incremental Management**.

Instead of regenerating your entire sitemap from scratch every time, Luminosity treats your sitemap as a database of URLs. It tracks changes, handles priorities, and "compacts" updates efficiently, ensuring your sitemap is always fresh without killing your server.

## Key Features

- **Streaming Architecture**: Handles millions of URLs with minimal memory footprint.
- **Smart Governance**: Built-in lifecycle management (Create, Update, Delete, Warm).
- **LSM-Tree Inspired**: Utilizes Log-Structured Merge patterns for high-throughput URL ingestion.
- **Automated Compliance**: Automatic `robots.txt` generation and sitemap index splitting (50k limit).
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works perfectly with Gravito, Hono, Express, or any Node.js/Bun framework.

## CLI First

Luminosity is designed to be controlled via its powerful CLI, `lux`. You can inspect your sitemap stats, trigger compaction, or warm up your cache directly from your terminal.

```bash
bun lux stats
```
