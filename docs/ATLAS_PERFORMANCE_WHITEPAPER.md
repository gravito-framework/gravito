# 🌌 Gravito Atlas: Performance Whitepaper (v1.0)

> **Abstract:** This document details the performance characteristics of the `@gravito/atlas` Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). Benchmarks were conducted in a containerized environment to measure throughput, latency overhead, and memory stability under load.

## 1. Executive Summary

Atlas was engineered to solve the "Active Record Tax"—the performance penalty traditionally associated with rich ORM features like Eloquent or Rails. By leveraging modern JavaScript engines (V8/JavaScriptCore via Bun) and a JIT-optimized hydration kernel, Atlas achieves **40,000+ hydrated models per second**, effectively bridging the gap between high-level Developer Experience (DX) and low-level Query Builder performance.

### Key Metrics (SQLite Reference)
| Metric | Performance | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Read IOPS** | **1,117,000 ops/sec** | Direct Driver Speed Limit |
| **Write IOPS** | **117,000 ops/sec** | Bulk Insert via Query Builder |
| **ORM Hydration** | **42,000 models/sec** | Full Active Record Instantiation |
| **Overhead** | **< 0.02ms per row** | Cost of abstraction |

## 2. Methodology

The benchmark suite (`examples/atlas-benchmark`) runs strictly controlled scenarios in isolated Docker containers to eliminate host interference.

*   **Hardware:** Apple Silicon (via Docker virtualization)
*   **Runtime:** Bun v1.x (Linux arm64)
*   **Database:** SQLite (WAL Mode, In-Memory) for kernel CPU stress testing.
*   **Measurement:** `performance.now()` high-resolution timers.

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### 3.1. The "Active Record Tax"
Traditional ORMs often incur a 5x-10x performance penalty compared to raw SQL due to the cost of instantiating heavy classes for every row.

*   **Atlas Result:**
    *   **Raw SQL:** 1.1M rows/sec
    *   **Atlas Model:** 42k models/sec
    *   **Analysis:** While there is overhead (expected for features like Dirty Checking, Relationship Management, and Event Hooks), attaining **40k ops/sec** means Atlas can handle enterprise-grade traffic. For context, a typical high-traffic API endpoint serving 100 users/sec would barely register on Atlas's load capacity.

### 3.2. Memory Stability (The "OOM Killer")
A common failure mode in Node.js ORMs is `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit` when processing large CSVs or exports.

*   **Scenario:** Processing 50,000 records (approx. 50MB raw payload).
*   **Standard approach (`.all()`):** Would spike heap usage by ~150MB+ (Data + Object Overhead).
*   **Atlas approach (`.cursor()`):**
    *   **Heap Growth:** **~24 MB** (Stable)
    *   **Throughput:** **70,000 records/sec**
*   **Conclusion:** The Atlas Stream implementation successfully recycles memory, allowing finite resources to process infinite datasets.

### 3.3. Throughput Scaling
*   **Bulk Insert:** 117k records/sec. Atlas's Query Builder compiles optimized multi-row `INSERT` statements, minimizing database round-trips.
*   **Connection Pooling:** The benchmark verified stable operation under high concurrency using `mysql2` and `pg` pool implementations (verified in integration tests).

## 4. Security Architecture

Performance does not come at the cost of security. The benchmark suite validates that the **Auto-Parameterization Engine** remains active even under high-throughput scenarios.

*   **Zero-Copy Binding:** Values are passed directly to the driver's native binding mechanism without string interpolation.
*   **Identifier Protection:** All table/column names are escaped (`"column"` or `` `column` ``) to prevent structural injection.

## 5. Conclusion

Atlas is ready for production workloads. It delivers the ergonomic benefits of Laravel Eloquent (fluent API, relationships, scopes) with a runtime performance profile optimized for the modern JavaScript edge.
