# Laravel 12 MVC Parity

This page compares Gravito (core + Orbits) with Laravel 12’s “full-stack MVC” feature set, so we can see what is already covered, what is partially covered, and what is still missing.

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Implemented | Available today and usable in production flows |
| Partial | Works for common cases, but missing key Laravel-level capabilities |
| Missing | Not available yet (needs design + implementation) |

## Concept Mapping (Laravel → Gravito)

| Laravel | Gravito |
|--------|---------|
| Service Container, Service Providers | `gravito-core` (`Container`, `ServiceProvider`) |
| HTTP Kernel / Middleware | `gravito-core` Router + Hono middleware; Orbit-provided middleware (Auth/Session/…) |
| Exception Handler | `gravito-core` `PlanetCore` error + notFound handlers and hooks |
| Events / Listeners | `gravito-core` `EventManager` / `Listener` |
| Validation (FormRequest) | `@gravito/orbit-request` (`FormRequest`) + `@gravito/validator` |
| Views / Blade | `@gravito/orbit-view` (TSX template engine) / `@gravito/orbit-inertia` (Inertia bridge) |
| Database / Eloquent | `@gravito/orbit-db` (Drizzle-based DB layer) |
| Auth / Gate / Policies | `@gravito/orbit-auth` (guards + `Gate`) |
| Cache | `@gravito/orbit-cache` |
| Queue / Jobs | `@gravito/orbit-queue` |
| Scheduler | `@gravito/orbit-scheduler` |
| Mail | `@gravito/orbit-mail` |

| Sessions | Implemented | `@gravito/orbit-session` |
| CSRF protection | Implemented | `@gravito/orbit-session` |
| Cookie encryption | Implemented | `CookieJar` + AES-256-CBC Encrypter |

| “Flash” data patterns | Partial | Supported in validation flow; needs a standard API surface |

### Validation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| FormRequest-style validation | Implemented | Zod + Valibot supported |
| Authorization inside FormRequest | Implemented | Returns 403 or throws `AuthorizationException` via middleware helper |

| Server-rendered HTML entry | Implemented | App shell rendering via Orbit View / Core |
| SPA bridge (Inertia) | Implemented | `@gravito/orbit-inertia` |

### Database / ORM

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| Migrations (apply/status/fresh) | Partial | CLI wraps `drizzle-kit`; workflow still evolving |
| Seed runner | Partial | CLI runner exists; app-level conventions still evolving |
| Active Record-style models | Partial | `Model` exists; feature set is smaller than Eloquent |
| Relations | Partial | Common relations are supported; parity with Eloquent is not complete |
| Model factories | Missing | No standard factory system |
| Soft deletes | Implemented | `usesSoftDeletes` + `withTrashed()` / `onlyTrashed()` |
| Polymorphic relations | Missing | Requires ORM design work |

| Structured logging | Implemented | Core `Logger` |
| Exception reporting hooks | Implemented | `error:*` and `processError:*` hooks |

### Testing / Developer Experience

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| CLI (Artisan-like) | Partial | `route:list`, `tinker`, migrations; limited scaffolding |
| App skeleton/templates | Implemented | `templates/*` |
| First-class HTTP testing helpers | Missing | No test harness like Laravel’s `TestResponse` |
| Mail/Notification fakes | Missing | Needs test doubles + contracts |

## Roadmap Suggestions (Laravel-Style Completeness)

### P1 (Eloquent/Laravel ergonomics)

- Resource routes + route model binding are implemented; route cache is available as a named-routes manifest.
- Pagination helpers and soft deletes are implemented; remaining gaps are factories, polymorphic relations, and fuller Eloquent-like ergonomics.
- Auth hashing is implemented; password reset/email verification still needs end-to-end app workflows (mail + persistence + default controllers).

### P2 (Ecosystem and observability)

- Queue dashboard + job observability.
- Tracing/metrics/health-check Orbit (OpenTelemetry-ready).
- Testing fakes (mail/notifications/queue) + HTTP testing utilities.
