# Flux Website Proposal

## Goal
Position Flux as a standalone workflow engine that is reusable across frameworks, improving Gravito brand awareness while showcasing enterprise-grade workflow capabilities.

## Core Message
Flux is not “just a flow,” but a standardized workflow engine with state machine semantics, retries, observability, and reusability across projects.

## Site Structure

### 1) Home
- **Hero**: One-line positioning + 3 key benefits (State Machine, Retry/Trace, Cross‑framework)
- **Visual Demo**: Workflow diagram + code side‑by‑side (n8n‑style)
- **Use Cases**: Order fulfillment, media processing, data sync, notifications
- **Why Flux**: Compare vs ad‑hoc scripts and queue‑only retries
- **Quick Start**: Minimal install + example
- **Ecosystem**: Storage adapters, Trace, Integrations
- **CTA**: Docs, GitHub, Playground

### 2) Product Pages
- **Workflow as Code**: versionable, replayable, auditable
- **Observability & Trace**: Dev Viewer + Trace Sink
- **Reliability**: Retry/Timeout/Commit semantics
- **Integrations**: Kafka/Queue/Serverless examples

### 3) Demo / Playground
- **Interactive flow**: diagram + timeline replay
- **Step details**: runtime state, retries, errors

## Content Notes
- Emphasize “reusable workflows” and “framework‑agnostic engine”
- Contrast with queue‑only retry behavior
- Show both dev‑time clarity and production‑grade tracing

## Next Steps
- Create wireframes for Home + Demo
- Draft hero copy + product messaging
- Decide visual style (n8n‑inspired nodes vs Gravito UI)
