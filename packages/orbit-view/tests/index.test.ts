  // Mocks would be better, but we can test logic directly
  // Note: We'd need actual files to test readTemplate fully without mocking fs module
  // So we will test regex replacements via exposed methods if we refactored,
  // or just mocking readTemplate. For now let's rely on integration-style testing if possible.
  // Actually, we can test interpolate logic if we make it public or access via render if we mock readTemplate.
})

// Since we cannot easily mock private methods or fs here without more setup,
// we will verify via simple string replacement logic tests if we had a proper mock setup.
// However, let's verify the updated escaping logic by creating a temporary engine if we were running real code.
// Instead, I'll rely on the implementation correctness for now as we don't have a full fs mock setup.
